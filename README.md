### Abstract:
Technical debt refers to the situation that shortcuts or workarounds are taken to achieve short-term goals, which might negatively influence long-term benefits. Recently, lots of studies have focused on technical debt that is admitted by developers in source code comments (namely, self-admitted technical debt (SATD)). Besides, technical debt is also admitted in issue trackers, but relatively unexplored. In a manual examination of 500 issues from two open source projects (i.e. Hadoop and Camel), we identify and study the types, the introduction, and the repayment of 152 SATD items, and find that: 1) eight types of technical debt are identified in issues, namely architecture, build, code, defect, design, documentation, requirement, and test debt; 2) developers identify technical debt in issues in three cases, and a small part is identified by its creators; 3) it took 25.0 and 872.3 hours on median and on average to pay off technical debt in issue trackers.

### Content of the replication package:

In the replication package, the following materials are included:
* Codebook.pdf - The definitions of types and indicators of technical debt that are used for manual classification.
* Technical_debt_classification.csv - The file includes a list of identified technical debt with their introduction, types, and repayment information.
* Analyzed_500_issues.zip - This zip file contains all 500 issues that we analyzed.
